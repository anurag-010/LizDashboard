## Installation

npm install
This command installs all the necessary dependencies required for the project to run. It reads the package.json file and installs all the packages listed under dependencies and devDependencies.

Viewing on Local Device
Once you've installed the dependencies, you can view the application on your local device using the following steps:

Start Development Server:
npm run dev
This command starts a development server, compiles your React application, and opens it in your default web browser.

Accessing the Application:
Once the development server is started, the application should automatically open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in any web browser.

By following these steps, you should be able to install the project's dependencies and view the application on your local device.
